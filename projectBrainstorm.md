# Project Planner for Personal Website :)

 ## Things to keep in mind:
	We need to store and use user data in localStorage.

 ## Possible projects I can build:

 ### World of Warcraft website





 ## Phase 1 - Dream Phase (WoW)
	   I can make a website that has information on every class. I 
	   can also put links to other websites that have info about the game.
	   The website will need a header with the title of the website and
	   maybe a small description or funny sentence. 
	   Put in some navigation bars with drop down menus. Also add
	   some cool CSS effects like hover, and change background color.
	   I can also put in some on click effects with jQuery to make 
	   certain elements do cool stuff like move around. I could also
	   put in a footer at the bottom which might have an about page 
	   or some other links. I can also add images to the page where necessary.

 ### Problem I want to solve
	 	Make a website that has every class and spec and a little info on each one.
	 	I also don't want it to be super complex or confusing, but rather simple 
	 	and easy to follow along and use. I can also store user data either on the
	 	front page or every page such as their realm and character name or asking
	 	some question.

 

 ## Phase 2 - The Drawing Board (WoW)
 
 ### MVP Tasks
 	1. Create a header with title
 		* Make a header tag
 		* Make a div and put name of website in it
 		* Try to center it at the top
