# Project Planner for Personal Website :)

 ## Things to keep in mind:
	We need to store and use user data in localStorage.

 ## Possible projects I can build:

 ### World of Warcraft website





 ## Phase 1 - Dream Phase (WoW)
   I can make a website that has information on every class. I 
   can also put links to other websites that have info about the game.
   The website will need a header with the title of the website and
   maybe a small description or funny sentence. 
   Put in some navigation bars with drop down menus. Also add
   some cool CSS effects like hover, and change background color.
   I can also put in some on click effects with jQuery to make 
   certain elements do cool stuff like move around. I could also
   put in a footer at the bottom which might have an about page 
   or some other links. I can also add images to the page where necessary.
